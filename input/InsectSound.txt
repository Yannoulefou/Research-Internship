Task is to classify the psuedo-acoustic series produced by an insects wingbeat.

The dataset was generated by the UCR computational entomology group. Instances are amplitude modulated intervals produced by the occlution of an infrared beam set within an enclosure housing a single specie of fly.
The dontated dataset consists of 10ms segments sampled at 6,000Hz
