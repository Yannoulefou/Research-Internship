# Research-Internship

This project explores supervised classification of time series with a focus on dimensionality reduction via random projections.
It provides a configurable and modular framework for experimenting with different parameters, enabling reproducible benchmarks.
The study also includes an in-depth analysis of learning curves to understand the trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy, and data size.
